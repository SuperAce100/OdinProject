    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the heavy cream and milk. Place the saucepan over medium heat and heat the mixture until it reaches a gentle simmer. Do not let it boil.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the sugar, egg yolks, and salt until well combined.</li>
        <li>Gradually pour about 1/2 cup of the hot cream mixture into the egg mixture, whisking constantly. This will temper the eggs and prevent them from curdling.</li>
        <li>Pour the tempered egg mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining cream mixture. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or spatula, until the mixture thickens and coats the back of the spoon. This should take about 5-7 minutes. Be careful not to let the mixture boil.</li>
        <li>Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Allow the mixture to cool to room temperature. Then, cover the saucepan and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight to chill thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Once the mixture is chilled, pour it into an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions until it reaches a soft-serve consistency.</li>
        <li>Transfer the churned ice cream to a lidded container and freeze for at least 4 hours, or until firm.</li>
        <li>Serve the homemade vanilla ice cream in bowls or cones and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        You can also customize your vanilla ice cream by adding mix-ins such as chocolate chips, crushed cookies, or fruit during the last few minutes of churning. Enjoy your delicious homemade vanilla ice cream!
